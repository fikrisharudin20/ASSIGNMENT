## Problems Encountered & Solutions

Describe the problems encountered and provide the solutions / plan for the solutions.

1. The first problem that we had encountered was figuring out how to randomize the objects on the game board as everytime the Alien moves, the objects in the board will be randomized again. 

Solution : Creating Vector for Alien Placement
           Coordinates System

2. The Zombie seem to not load on certain board dimensions, we tried our best to figure out and tried everything to figure out for the solution.
Nontheless, The game is still playable.
