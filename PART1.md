## Minimum Requirements

### Completed

List all the features completed.

1. Customizable Gameboard
2. Movement of Alien

### To Do

List all the features not yet done. Remove this section if there is no incomplete requirements.

1. Randomized game objects
2. Game Flow
3. Game Characters
4. Saving and loading system


## Additional Features

1. For a more user-friendly experience, we had decided on making the movement of the Alien as strings instead of one output, therefore, if the user
inputs, (w,w,w,w), the alien will move up four times without the hassle of typing out each input.

## Problems Encountered & Solutions

1. The first problem that we had encountered was figuring out how to randomize the objects on the game board as everytime the Alien moves, the objects in the board will be randomized again. 

Our plans to overcome : 

                        a. Defining the arrays with the objects outside of the loop of gameboard.
                        Explanation : As our board-creation code has a system(cls) function, it might intertwine with the objects in the arrays 

                        b.  Using the shuffle function 
                        Explanation : We might opt for shuffle function as it can shuffle the elements in the array randomly
